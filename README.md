# Kaggle's digit recognizer challenge
This is NashFP's playground for solving Kaggle's Digit Recognizer challenge. 

In August 2013, Mathias Brandewinder [visited Nashville](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/coding-dojo-a-gentle-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-f-tickets-7334733385)
to lead a machine learning in F# dojo. The dojo built on top of the digit recognizer challenge. It was a blast. 
Later this dojo was packaged (with slides, data, and solutions) and [placed here](https://github.com/c4fsharp/Dojo-Digits-Recognizer). 


The summary for the dojo:
> This Dojo is inspired by the Kaggle Digit Recognizer contest. The goal is to write a Machine Learning classifier from scratch, a program that will recognize hand-written digits automatically. It is a guided Dojo, suitable for beginners: the Dojo comes with a Script file, with specific tasks to complete, introducing along the way numerous F# concepts and syntax examples. The Dojo is on the longer side; for a group with limited F# experience, it is recommended to schedule it for 2 hours and a half.

## Playground
For this playground follow Mathias's guidance and solve the problem using your functional language of choice. 
Contribute your solution by adding a folder named {your twitter handle}+{your language} such as:
`/bryan_hunter+erlang/`

You can push your changes, but it's more fun to submit your solution via pull-request. Time to play!

## The data sets
The full data sets `train.csv` (73.22 mb) and `test.csv` (48.75 mb) can be found here:

For your convenience the smaller data sets (used in the dojo) are contained here in the repo:  
training-sample.csv (5000 rows, 9.1 mb)  
test-sample.csv (500 rows, 919 kb)
